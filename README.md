Hi there! 👋 I'm **Maneesha**, and this is one of my early web development projects — a cozy café-themed website that I built to practice and apply my skills in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap**.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project was created as a part of my web development learning journey. The goal was to:
- Understand the basics of structuring a webpage with HTML
- Style the layout using CSS and Bootstrap
- Build a responsive and aesthetically pleasing single-page site
- Simulate a real-world use case: a café + reading space

## 🖼️ Key Features

- ✅ Responsive navigation bar
- ✅ Scrollable single-page layout
- ✅ Custom color scheme and section styling
- ✅ Bootstrap grid system for mobile compatibility
- ✅ Simple contact section with multiple locations

## 💻 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 5
- Font Awesome (optional for icons)


## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to structure content semantically using HTML
- Styling techniques using both custom CSS and Bootstrap classes
- Building a responsive layout that works across screen sizes
- Using navigation links to smoothly scroll to different sections

## 📈 Future Goals

- Add a dynamic photo gallery
- Integrate animations on scroll (using AOS or ScrollReveal.js)
- Add form validation with JavaScript
- Use Google Fonts for enhanced typography
